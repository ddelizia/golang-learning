## Idiomatic Go

In order to be a good go developer you need to make sure to write idiomatic code.

## How to Structure Go application (DDD + HEX Arch)

My favorite way to structure Go application in order to have idiomatic package/code/structure is using Domain Driven Design with Exagonal Architecture. Here is a list of resources about that.
